## Organization of the code?

A simpler template of the code is also available at http://www.ifmlab.org/files/template/IFM_Lab_Program_Template_Python3.zip

### The whole program is divided into five main parts:

(1) data.py (for data loading and basic data organization operators, defines abstract method load() )

(2) method.py (for complex operations on the data, defines abstract method run() )

(3) result.py (for saving/loading results from files, defines abstract method load() and save() )

(4) evaluate.py (for result evaluation, defines abstract method evaluate() )

(5) setting.py (for experiment settings, defines abstract method load_run_save_evaluate() )

The other inherited class will implement these abstract methonds.
